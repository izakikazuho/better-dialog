import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash

    npm install better-dialog

    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash

    yarn add better-dialog

    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

### 1. Write the HTML

```html
<button data-better-dialog-show="my-dialog">Open Dialog</button>

<dialog id="my-dialog">
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
  <button data-better-dialog-close>Close</button>
</dialog>
```

### 2. Initialize with JavaScript

```js
import { BetterDialog } from 'better-dialog';

new BetterDialog('#my-dialog');
```

That's it — you now have a working modal, powered by the native `<dialog>` element.

:::note
Better Dialog does **not include any CSS styles by default**.
It only controls dialog behavior and accessibility — styling is completely up to you.

This design gives you full control and avoids style conflicts in your project.
