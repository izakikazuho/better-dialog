---

Better Dialog supports animations for opening and closing modals via a simple, plugin-like API.  
You can choose between built-in helpers or write your own.

This page covers the built-in `fade()Animation` and `css()Animation` animation utilities.

## Using `fadeAnimation()`

The `fadeAnimation()` animation uses the Web Animations API to smoothly fade the modal and its backdrop in and out.

### Example

```ts
import { BetterDialog } from 'better-dialog';
import { fadeAnimation } from 'better-dialog/animations';

new BetterDialog('#my-dialog', {
  animation: fadeAnimation({ duration: 300 }),
});
```

### What it does

- Fades in the `<dialog>` element from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`
- Animates the `::backdrop` pseudo-element as well
- Works in modern browsers that support `Element.animate()`

## Using `cssAnimation()`

If you prefer to define your own animations in CSS, use the `cssAnimation()` helper.  
This simply adds and removes CSS classes for "show" and "close" transitions.

### Example

```ts
import { BetterDialog } from 'better-dialog';
import { cssAnimation } from 'better-dialog/animations';

new BetterDialog('#my-dialog', {
  animation: cssAnimation({
    duration: 300,
    showClass: 'fade-in',
    closeClass: 'fade-out',
  }),
});
```

### Sample CSS

```css
.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease forwards;
}

.fade-out {
  animation: fadeOut 0.3s ease forwards;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

## Writing Custom Animations

You can also create your own animation function if needed.  
See the [API Reference](/api/animations) for how to implement a custom `AnimFunction`.
